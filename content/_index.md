I am a University of Toronto graduate having studied math and computer
science. Some of my current interests are mathematical finance,
differential geometry, game theory, and neural networks. Please feel
free to reach out to me using any of my links provided at the bottom of the page.

My resume can be found [here](/home/Jason_Li_resume.pdf).

## Recent Work
### [Generating Functions: A Gentle Introduction to a Different Way of Counting](/home/generatingFunctions.pdf)
Here are the slides I made for a talk I gave at the 30th Canadian Undergraduate Math conference.
I covered the basics of generating functions including examples with applications in combinatorics, number theory, and computer science.

### [An Analysis of Ensemble Methods for Deep Learning in the Diagnosis of Eye Diseases](/home/ensemble_methods_eye_diseases.pdf)
I worked on a study of performance of neural network ensemble methods for medical
imaging in the application of eye disease. We managed to achieve a 3% improvement over the dataset 
benchmarks.

### [Topological Data Analysis](/home/topological_data_analysis.pdf)
An introductory paper about the applications of topology in studying
high dimensional data. The basics of simplicial complexes are covered with the eventual lead up 
to the nerve theorem
