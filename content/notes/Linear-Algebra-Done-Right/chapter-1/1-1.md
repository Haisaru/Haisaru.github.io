Question: Show that $\alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$.

Answer: Let $\alpha = a + ib$ and $\beta = c + id$ be given.

Then, 
$$
\alpha + \beta = (a + ib) + (c + id)
= (a + c) + i(b + d)
= (c + a) + i(d + b)
= \beta + \alpha
$$

Where the middle equalites come from the properties of $\mathbb{R}$.
